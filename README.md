# Optimization_Visualization
Visualization Personal Project for the visualization of different optimization Algorithms in the face of relevant loss shapes.
Six algorithms are implemented in js:
- Gradient Descent
- Gradient Descent with Momentum
- Gradient Descent with Nesterov Momentum
- RMSProp
- Adam
- BFGS
- Newton

A large number of 1D and 2D test functions are implemented with a wide range of different properties (Scale inhomogeneity, Local Minima, Non-Stationary functions ect...).

# Interactive integration
The program is fully interactive, click anywhere on the plot to start an optimization procedure with the selected parameters.
